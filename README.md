🌿 Paradise Nursery Shopping Application
📝 Project Description

The Paradise Nursery Shopping Application is an interactive web project built using React.js and Redux Toolkit.
It simulates an online plant store where users can explore a variety of plants — including aromatic and medicinal types — add them to the shopping cart, adjust quantities, and view the total price dynamically.

This project was developed as a final project for the IBM CognitiveClass.ai React course.
It demonstrates core React concepts such as functional components, state management with Hooks, Redux integration, and event handling in a modern e-commerce UI.

🚀 Key Features

A Landing Page with a welcome message and navigation button to the product list.

A Product Listing Page divided into multiple categories (e.g., Aromatic Plants, Medicinal Plants).

Product cards showing image, name, description, price, and an Add to Cart button.

A Cart Page displaying added items, quantity controls, delete option, and dynamic total price.

Real-time cart updates displayed in the Navigation Bar icon.

💡 Ideas for Future Improvements

Integrate search and filter functionality to help users find plants quickly.

Add a favorites or wishlist feature to save preferred plants.

Connect the app to a real backend API for fetching products dynamically.

Implement a checkout system with order summary and confirmation page.

Add dark/light mode theme switching for better user experience.

Make the app fully responsive across all screen sizes.

🧩 Planned Customizations

Improve the UI/UX design using TailwindCSS or Material UI.

Add animations for smoother transitions between pages.

Customize the product data and categories to match a unique nursery brand.

Enhance cart logic to prevent duplicate items and calculate totals more efficiently.

Deploy the app on GitHub Pages and include screenshots in this README.
